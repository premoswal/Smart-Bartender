# Smart-Bartender
My final year project. Its a drink making machine which can make various list of drinks according to user.
User can make drink with 2 methodes,
1]manually using rotay encoder
2]connecting mobile with SMART BARTENDER using bluetooth and giving commands via mobile application.
3]mobile application using can be downloaded for free from playstore. Name of application (serial Bluetooth). 


software part and little explanation:

1] File uploaded with name SMART BARTENDER contains complete code.
2] I have used PlatformIO for programming my ESP32. If you are using ESP32 then you can directly flash code to your esp32.
3] Every file in SCR with .cpp extension contents code for that specific opertation in project.
4] There in debounce code for rotary encoder in encoder.cpp which works very reliably.

I will soon upload complete schematic for better understanding and project images for refrence
